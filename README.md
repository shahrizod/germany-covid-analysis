# Covid-19 Trends in Germany
For this project, I collaborated with a peer to effectively apply various data science techniques on a dataset of Covid-19 statistics in Germany to anaylze trends and predict future ones. To do so, we used a multitude of libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy and Scikit-learn. In particular, we used Pandas to import our data and clean or filter it whenever necessary through the use of dataframes, Matplotlib to create a plethora of charts and graphs, Numpy to perform reshaping operations for our models, and Scikit-learn to help us create our linear regression, logistic regression, k-means clustering, as well as the necessary tools to evaluate these models like accuracy, precision, F-1 score, and cross-validation. In this project, we sought out to analyze county-level COVID-19 data to observe the differences in infection and death rates among differing gender and age-groups. Additionally, we aimed to accurately predict the survival of a COVID patient through several machine learning models, which proved to be quite promising as a means to handle crisis. Further details regarding our findings can be found in the pdf report within this repository.
